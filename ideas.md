  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Minimalism / Data Brutalism
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Data as Art**: Data visualizations are not just content but the primary aesthetic driver.
  2. **High Contrast & Precision**: Stark contrasts between deep backgrounds and razor-sharp data lines.
  3. **Functional Transparency**: Glassmorphism used not for decoration but to layer complex information hierarchies.
  4. **Motion with Meaning**: Animations are strictly tied to data updates and user interactions, simulating a live system.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Void Backgrounds** (`#020617`): Represents the vastness of economic data.
  - **Electric Blue Accents** (`#38bdf8`): Signifies clarity, intelligence, and the "pulse" of the community.
  - **Signal Colors**: Emerald for growth, Rose for alerts—used sparingly to maintain high signal-to-noise ratio.
  - *Intent*: To evoke a sense of professional-grade, mission-critical software used in high-stakes environments.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Grid Evolution**: Modular, dashboard-like layouts that adapt to screen size.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Hero sections that offset heavy typography with dynamic, interactive 3D data visualizations.
  - **HUD-Inspired Navigation**: Floating, accessible controls that feel like a heads-up display.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Grid Lines & Crosshairs**: Subtle background patterns that suggest precision and measurement.
  2. **Monospace Data Tags**: Micro-labels in `JetBrains Mono` for technical credibility.
  3. **Glowing Edges**: Subtle borders that breathe with activity.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Hover states that trigger "scan" lines or highlight data points.
  - **Instant Response**: Zero-latency feel for all UI interactions.

  **Animation**:
  - **Sequential Data Loading**: Charts load with a "drawing" effect.
  - **Glitch/Decode Text**: Headlines appear as if being decoded.
  - **Pulse Effects**: Live data indicators gently pulse to show system activity.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `Inter` (Bold/ExtraBold) - Clean, authoritative, legible.
  - **Body**: `Inter` (Regular) - Neutral and readable.
  - **Data/UI**: `JetBrains Mono` - For numbers, labels, and technical details.

  **Design Movement**: Organic Futurism / Solarpunk Data
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Human-Centric Data**: Visualizing data as organic flows rather than rigid bars.
  2. **Soft Tech**: Technology that feels approachable and supportive of community growth.
  3. **Fluid Connectivity**: emphasizing the connections between data points and community outcomes.
  4. **Warmth in Precision**: Using warmer tones within the tech palette to suggest human impact.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Navy Base**: A softer alternative to pure black.
  - **Bioluminescent Gradients**: Teals, cyans, and soft purples that blend organically.
  - **Warm Accents**: Amber and soft coral to highlight "community" aspects.
  - *Intent*: To frame economic data as a tool for nurturing and growing communities, not just cold statistics.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Fluid Containers**: Rounded, soft-edged containers that flow into one another.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Depth created by soft shadows and layering, not hard borders.
  - **Centralized Flow**: Layouts that guide the eye down a central narrative path.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Mesh Gradients**: Backgrounds that shift slowly like living organisms.
  2. **Rounded Data Viz**: Curved lines, rounded bar caps, and bubble charts.
  3. **Glass with Grain**: Frosted glass effects with subtle noise for texture.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Liquid Motion**: Elements morph and stretch slightly during interaction.
  - **Soft Hovers**: Gentle glows and lifts rather than sharp color changes.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float & Drift**: Background elements gently float.
  - **Fade & Blur**: Transitions use blur-in effects for a dreamy, high-tech feel.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `Plus Jakarta Sans` - Geometric but friendly.
  - **Body**: `Inter` - Clean and legible.
  - **Accents**: `Space Grotesk` - For a touch of futuristic character.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Industrial / Swiss Digital
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Adherence**: Strict adherence to a visible or implied grid system.
  2. **Typographic Dominance**: Large, bold typography as the primary graphical element.
  3. **Structural Integrity**: UI elements that look "bolted" or structured.
  4. **Information Density**: High density of information presented with absolute clarity.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Slate & Concrete**: Shades of grey and slate blue (`#1e293b`).
  - **International Orange**: High-visibility accents for calls to action.
  - **Stark White**: For primary text and data.
  - *Intent*: To convey stability, infrastructure, and foundational economic strength.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Blocks**: Distinct, separated content blocks with clear borders.
  - **Split Screens**: Vertical divisions separating data from narrative.
  - **Sticky Headers/Sidebars**: Persistent navigation tools.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Thick Borders**: Visible dividers between sections.
  2. **Technical Iconography**: Sharp, detailed icons.
  3. **Raw Materials**: Textures resembling digital concrete or carbon fiber.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Mechanical Switches**: Toggles and buttons feel mechanical and clicky.
  - **Snap Scrolling**: Sections snap into place.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Panels slide in from off-screen.
  - **Typewriter Effect**: Text appears character by character.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `Archivo` - Heavy, industrial feel.
  - **Body**: `Roboto` - Neutral, mechanical.
  - **Data**: `Roboto Mono` - For tabular data.
